## 1. Project Overview & Goal

### Dataset & Source
This project utilises the [*Worldwide Travel Cities (Ratings and Climate*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/furkanima/worldwide-travel-cities-ratings-and-climate) sourced from Kaggle, contains 560 records and 19 attributes.

This dataset contains travel information for 560 cities worldwide, including city data (name, country, region, coordinates), descriptive summaries, climate data (monthly avg/min/max temperatures), ideal trip durations, budget levels, and ratings of features of the city such as culture, nature, cuisine, wellness, nightlife, and beaches.

### Project's Focus
Our project focuses on analysing global travel destinations using the Worldwide Travel Cities dataset to understand how factors like budget level, climate, and other attributes influence trip choices. We aim to explore patterns in travel ratings, duration preferences, and climate characteristics across 560 cities.

#### Key Research Questions
The goal for this  project is was explored using the following research questions. We created hypothese for each question based on what we expected to find and that was the guide for our analysis.

1. **Are luxury destinations associated with higher temperatures?**
    
    Hypothesis: Luxury destinations will be located in cities that have higher average temperatures compared to mid-range and budget destinations.
   
2. **Do budget levels influence trip duration?**

    Hypothesis: Budget-friendly destinations will be associated with shorter recommended trip durations compared to mid-range and luxury destinations.

## 2. Tools & Technologies

- **Trello**
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** 
- **Jupyter Notebook** 
- **GitHub (Version Control)**
- **Power BI (dashboard)** 

<br>

## 3. Target Audience 

The dashboard and interactive tool are intended for:

**1. Travellers who want help choosing a destination -** Those looking for travel suggestions based on a budget, continent, climate, or travel style.

**2. Tourism platforms exploring location insights -** For travel related companies, such as airlines or package holidays companies that are looking for data insights to optimise their offerings.

<br>

## 4. Expected Deliverables

Our final outputs for the hackathon will be:

- Clean, structured dataset ready for analysis

- Power BI/Tableau dashboard with interactive visuals

- Streamlit mini-app for destination recommendations

- Project documentation (e.g. README, Project Proposal etc)

- Final presentation summarising findings, insights, and recommendations

## 6. How to Run the Project Locally

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/renewedspirit/insurance-claim-analysis]

cd Worldwide_Travel_Analysis
```

### Install Dependencies

You will need a ```requirements.txt``` file listing pandas, numpy, streamlit, etc.
Open your terminal or a Jupyter cell and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Notebook

Open `spf_analysis.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially. The notebook will automatically download the data, run the ETL pipeline, and generate all seaborn/matplotlib visualizations.

## 7. Challenges


#### Data Architect 
- Responsible for designing the structure of the dataset used for analysis.  
- Led the ETL process, including cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering.  
- Ensured the data was consistent, well-organised, and ready for modelling and visualisation. 

#### Data Analysts
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and investigated the key research questions.  
- Developed visualisations to uncover trends and support insights.  
- Worked closely with the data architect to interpret transformed features.

#### Dashboard Developer
- Built the interactive dashboard and visualisations (Power BI).  
- Designed user-friendly layouts and filter systems for exploring the data.  
- Integrated insights into visual storytelling for the final project deliverables.

#### Project Management
Trello was used in the planning of this Capstone Project. It was used to do the following: 
- Planning and outlining the project proposal
- Identify tasks to be done to complete the project
- Track progress of each task to completion
